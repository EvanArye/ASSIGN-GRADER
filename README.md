PYTHON PROGRAMMING 101: ASSIGN GRADER

This program defines a function called assign_grade that determines a studentâ€™s letter grade based on their numeric score. The function first checks if the score is between 0 and 100, and if not, it prints an error message asking for a valid score. If the score is valid, it uses conditional statements to print the corresponding grade based on predefined ranges.
